{"name":"Skizze","tagline":"A remote sketch storage for data streams","body":"# Skizze\r\nSkizze ([ˈskɪt͡sə]: german for sketch) is a sketch data store to deal with all problems around counting and sketching using probabilistic data-structures.\r\n\r\nUnlike a Key-Value store, Skizze does not store values, but rather appends values to a defined sketches, allowing one to solve frequency and cardinality queries in near O(1) time, with minimal memory footprint.\r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b> Data structures that can grow too big to reside in memory are read and written from/to disk directly via open stream to make sure we can maintain a high number of sketches.\r\n\r\n#### Current status ==> pre-Alpha\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis and mining of huge multi-terabyte data sets is a common task nowadays, especially in the areas like web analytics and Internet advertising. Analysis of such large data sets often requires powerful distributed data stores like Hadoop and heavy data processing with techniques like MapReduce. This approach often leads to heavyweight high-latency analytical processes and poor applicability to realtime use cases. On the other hand, when one is interested only in simple additive metrics like total page views or average price of conversion, it is obvious that raw data can be efficiently summarized, for example, on a daily basis or using simple in-stream counters.  Computation of more advanced metrics like a number of unique visitor or most frequent items is more challenging and requires a lot of resources if implemented straightforwardly.\r\n\r\nSkizze is a (fire and forget) service that provides a probabilistic data structures (sketches) storage that allow one to estimate these and many other metrics and trade precision of the estimations for the memory consumption. These data structures can be used both as temporary data accumulators in query processing procedures and, perhaps more important, as a compact – sometimes astonishingly compact – replacement of raw data in stream-based computing.\r\n\r\n## Example queries/use cases?\r\n* How many distinct elements are in the data set (i.e. what is the cardinality of the data set)?\r\n* What are the most frequent elements (the terms “heavy hitters” and “top-k elements” are also used)?\r\n* What are the frequencies of the most frequent elements?\r\n* How many elements belong to the specified range (range query, in SQL it looks like `SELECT count(v) WHERE v >= c1 AND v < c2)?`\r\n* Does the data set contain a particular element (membership query)?\r\n\r\n## API\r\n### RESTful API\r\n\r\n| Method | Route      | Parameters                   | Task |\r\n| ---    | ---        | ---                          | --- |\r\n| GET    | /          | N/A                          | Lists all available sketches (sketches) |\r\n| MERGE  | /          | not implemented yet          | Merges multiple sketches of the same <type> if they support merging |\r\n| POST   | /$type/$id | {\"capacity\": uint64}         | Creates a new <type> sketch with id: <id> |\r\n| GET    | /$type/$id | (optional) {\"values\": [string, string]} | Get cardinality/frequency/rank of a sketch (for given values if supported by the sketch type) |\r\n| PUT    | /$type/$id | {\"values\": [string, string]} | Updates a sketch by adding values to it |\r\n| PURGE  | /$type/$id | {\"values\": [string, string]} | Updates a sketch by purging values from it |\r\n| DELETE | /$type/$id | N/A                          | Deletes a sketch. |\r\n\r\n### Sketch Types\r\n\r\n| type  | purpose     | Sketch               | Description                              | Notes |\r\n| ---   | ---         | ---                  | ---                                      | ---   |\r\n| hllpp | cardinality | HyperLogLog++        | query unique items from all added values | capacity up to billions, does not support purging added values |\r\n| cml   | frequency   | Count-Min-Log Sketch | query frequency of unique values added   | N/A |\r\n| topk  | rank + frequncy | Top-k Sketch | query the top k values added to the sketch | N/A |\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
