{"name":"Skizze","tagline":"A domain-sketch data store","body":"### What is Skizze? \r\n##### TL;DR\r\nSkizze is an open source, Apache licensed, probabilistic data-structures distributed cache and store, serving the following type of counts:\r\n* cardinality (using HyperLogLog++): <desc here>\r\n* purgable cardinality (using Cuckoofilter): <desc here>\r\n* frequency (using Count-Min-Log sketch): <desc here>\r\n* purgable frequency (using Count-Mean-Min sketch): <desc here>\r\n* topk (using topK): <desc here>\r\n\r\n##### More details\r\nA domain-counter data store to deal with all problems around counting using probabilistic data-structures.\r\n\r\nUnlike a Key-Value store, counts does not store values, but rather keeps track of keys added to a domain, allowing you to solve frequency and cardinality queries in near O(1) time, with minimal memory footprint.\r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b> Data structures that can grow too big to reside in memory are read and written from/to disk directly via open stream to make sure we can maintain a high number of counters.\r\n\r\n### Use cases?\r\n* Is this URI in my spam list? (spam list over a million entries)\r\n* How many users like my post? (a like being subject to change)\r\n* How may times did oliver watch this video? (counting frequencies)\r\n* How many unique users visited my website in the last 3 hours? (sliding hyperloglog)\r\n* Who are the top 10 users contributing to my code?
